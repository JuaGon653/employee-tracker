# employee-tracker

## Description

For my 12th challenge in the coding bootcamp, I was required to create a content management system that a non-developer would use to easily view employee details and be able to add/update any information deemed necessary. Using a database with three different tables that end up joining with primary and foreign keys and packages like MySQL2, Inquirer, and console.table I was able to successfully implement everything needed for the challenge. Firstly, when the application is ran, the user encounters a menu that has a list of different tasks the user can select from. The options that are displayed consist of view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, update an employee role, and quit. Using SQL I was able to grab stored data from tables in the database and, in most cases, join them together to have a meaningful representation of the data that the user can easily read. In some cases, the user will be prompted for information when trying to add/update something. Lastly, after a task is successfully ran through, the user will be faced with the menu again until the 'quit' option is selected, causing the process end.
